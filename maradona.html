      Diego Armando Maradona was born on 30 October 1960, at the Policlínico
      (Polyclinic) Evita Hospital in Lanús, Buenos Aires Province to a poor
      family that had moved from Corrientes Province; he was raised in Villa
      Fiorito, a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires,
      Argentina.
      <hr />
      [14] He was the first son after four daughters. He has two younger
      brothers, Hugo (el Turco) and Raúl (Lalo), both of whom were also
      professional football players. His father Diego Maradona "Chitoro"
      (1927–2015), who worked at a chemicals factory, was of Guaraní
      (Indigenous) and Spanish (Basque) descent, and his mother Dalma Salvadora
      Franco, "Doña Tota" (1930–2011), was of Italian descent.[15]
